When I was 5 years old I was maimed by a giant rabbit.

But.

I knew.

Revenge is a sweet thing.

I knew.

I will plant seeds of revenge and let them grow. Then I'll harvest the vegetables of revenge.

And from those vegetables, I will plant more seeds.

From the third or perhaps fourth harvest renge-plants, I will make a vegetable stew, and season it perfectly.

With revenge!
